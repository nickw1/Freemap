<h1>What is Freemap?</h1>
<hr />
<p><em>Freemap</em> is a project to create free and
annotatable maps of the UK countryside, using 
<a href='http://www.openstreetmap.org'>OpenStreetMap</a> data to create the
maps. Freemap maps aim to show not only the official rights of way, but 
all paths with public access, many of which are missing on other maps.</p>
<h2 id='mapkey'>Map key</h2>
The following diagram (based on a previous version, but
the current version of Freemap is to all intents and purposes identical)
shows the colour scheme for different types of path
(permissive footpaths, not shown here, are light blue):

<p>
The maps consist of two layers. The top layer (coloured) shows the routes
with public access, as shown above.
The lower layer (black and white) gives an indication
of the path's physical condition, for example whether it's a dirt path, a
track, or a farm access road. The second diagram shows examples of the lower
layer, and also shows a permissive footpath:</p>

<p>Note how some paths and tracks have no coloured overlay. These are paths
and tracks for which walkers' rights are unknown, i.e. it is not known whether
they are walkable or private. Also note the public footpath in the top 
centre of the map, and how its southern end follows a farm access road and
its northern end follows a track.</p>
