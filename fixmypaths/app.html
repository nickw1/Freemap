<h1>The FixMyPaths App - Testers Wanted!</h1>
<p>
The <em>FixMyPaths Android app</em> allows you to report the problems on 
rights of way <em>while out on a walk</em>. It currently works in Hampshire,
West Sussex, Wiltshire and Surrey.
Say you come across a missing signpost,
or a blocked path, you can fire up the app and report the problem
directly to the FixMyPaths database. If you are in
Hampshire, the problems will be sent 
<em>directly to Hampshire County Council (it is the intention to expand out of
Hampshire in the future)</em>. The app
will contact the FixMyPaths server to find out if there is a nearby right of
way, and if there is, you will be given the chance to enter the problem report.
The report will be stored in FixMyPaths' own database <em>and</em> emailed
to Hampshire County Council if in Hampshire. 
The app is in an early stage of development and
has been tested by myself live in-the-field, but I am looking for
<em>additional testers</em>. So if you live in or near this part of southern
England, like walking,
and have an Android 2.1+ phone, please 
<a href='http://www.free-map.org.uk/downloads/android/fixmypaths.apk'>
download the app</a> and get testing!</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> Please note that the 
<a href='http://acra.ch'>ACRA</a>
library has been included in FixMyPaths. This will send off a bug report
if the app crashes for any reason, with the possible effect
(as is the case for any data sent to a server) of incurring
charges to your phone account. This is to help debugging.
Please do not install if you are not happy with this!</p>
<h2>Instructions to use the app</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Installing the FixMyPaths app to your phone
is at your <em>own risk</em>. It is software at an early stage of development;
it appears to be stable in tests but please do not blame me if it blows
up your phone. With that warning over, here are the instructions on how to
install and use the app.</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all configure your phone to allow installation of non-Market
(Google Play) apps. This will be under Settings: on a Samsung Galaxy SIII,
it is under "Security and Lock Screen". On the HTC Hero, it's under
"Applications". So try a settings category that looks like either of those
two.</li>
<li>When the app is run for the first time, you will be prompted to download
a small style file: a file which specifies the style of the maps. Download
this: it's only 4K.</li>
<li>You now need to install one or more maps. Simply run the app within a
wifi area and select the "Download county map" option. Select one of the
counties to download the map to the device. These maps are 4 to 9 megabytes
so the download is best done in a wifi area.
	<ul>
	<li>If you do not have access to wifi, 
	you might need to download the map file
	from a desktop or laptop and copy it to the phone's SD card.
	Connect your phone up to
	your desktop or laptop and find the SD card folder (on the Samsung Galaxy 
	SIII you should select the Phone folder instead, as on this model the map 
	is stored on the actual phone). Inside this folder, there is a
	folder called "openhants". Download the appropriate map file from
	<a href='http://www.free-map.org.uk/data/android/fixmypaths/'>
	here</a> and place it in the "openhants" folder.
	If you are having difficulty with this step please email me on
	freemapinfo at gmail dot com.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Having downloaded one or more maps, choose the current map with the
"Choose county map" option.</li>
<li>You should now be ready to go. Ensure that GPS is switched on, fill in
your name and email in the preferences (menu-preferences), find somewhere
suitable and report your problem! (for the testing period, this may be a
"fake" problem). There will soon be a "Download existing problems"
option which ensures that you do not try to report an existing problem
by showing them on the map.</li>
<li>As well as reporting a problem at the precise location it occurs, you can
also report a problem by tapping the map at an arbitrary location (as long as
it's near a path, obviously!) Through the preference options, you can also
specify to save problems on the phone while out walking (rather than 
uploading to the server) and then upload when you get back.</li>
<li>Please report your experiences to me, Nick Whitelegg
at freemapinfo at gmail dot com.</li>
</ol>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
<p>Android 2.1+ needed. I have tested it on two devices: on the one hand an
HTC Hero and on the other a Samsung Galaxy SIII. On the Hero the map drawing
is rather slow and prone to occasional crashes while on the SIII it runs
smoothly. I'd be interested to know what performance is like on different
"in-between" models, again please email me (freemapinfo at gmail dot com).</p>
