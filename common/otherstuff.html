<h1>Other stuff...</h1>
<hr />
<p>This page collects together various online and standalone
software that I have developed over the years.
Much of it is for historical interest only, but some of it may be useful to you
and it's all open source so needs to be offered
for download somewhere :-)</p>
<h2>Online software</h2>
<p>Source code for all online software, and 
<a href='#opentrail'>OpenTrail</a>
is available via Gitlab at the 
address <a href="https://gitlab.com/nickw1/">
https://gitlab.com/nickw1/</a>.</p>
<h3>Freemap 3D</h3>
<p>
A demo 3D OSM viewer using WebGL and NASA SRTM height data. Available
<a href='http://www.free-map.org.uk/3d/'>here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Downloadable software</h2>
<h3 id='opentrail'>OpenTrail</h3>
<p>
OpenTrail is an in-the-field Android app for walkers, using Freemap maps.
Please see <a href="/common/opentrail.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id='hikar'>Hikar</h3>
<p>Hikar is an augmented reality OSM app aimed at walkers and hikers,
for more detail see <a href='hikar.html'>here</a>.</p>
<h3 id='walknotes'>Walknotes</h3>
<p>Android app for making Freemap annotations in the field. Make notes on
the walk you're doing, e.g. a nice view or path blockage, and upload to the
Freemap server while out on your walk. Currently requires in-the-field
net access, GPS and the APK needs Android 2.1+, though the source can  
probably be compiled for 1.x. Available
<a href='/downloads/android/walknotes.apk'>here</a>; source code
available <a href='/downloads/android/walknotes.tar.bz2'>here</a>.
<strong>NOTE:</strong>This was an experimental "first Android app" to get
used to Android development; Walknotes is now incorporated into
OpenTrail, above</p>
<h3>Other software</h3>
<p>The software below is likely to be of historical interest only, as it
either runs on systems seeing little use today (FreemapMobile) or has
not seen development for a number of years (e.g. Footnav). Nonetheless you
might wish to use the source code in your own projects.</p>
<h4>FreemapMobile</h4>
<p>A JavaME client for Freemap, written mostly in summer 2008. 
Available <a href='../downloads/FreemapMobile/FreemapMobile_r3fe.zip'>
here</a>. Shows Freemap, OSM Mapnik, Osmarender, or out-of-copyright OS maps
on your Java ME-enabled phone with GPS. Tested on the Nokia N95. 
Superseded by OpenTrail, above</p>
<h4>Footnav</h4>
<p>A start on an OpenGL and Qt based 3D viewer 
of OSM and SRTM data. Not taken further
as my interest shifted to WebGL and Android, but source available
<a href='/downloads/footnav/'>here</a> should you wish to develop it further.
</p>
<h4>ZXLIB</h4>
<p>C++ library for developing ZX Spectrum-style 2D games on Linux and
Windows systems. Comes with tutorial,
documentation and simple examples. Based on SDL;
developed in 2002 so not guaranteed to work with current SDL. Available
<a href='/downloads/zxlib/'>here</a>.</p>
<h3>Old versions of Freemap</h3>
<p>The source code for various old versions of Freemap is available
<a href='/downloads/freemap'>here</a>.</p>
<h3>Other things</h3>
<p>A range of other software can be downloaded here; browse the
<a href='/downloads'>downloads directory</a>. Just about all of it is for 
historical interest only but is open source so here goes.
	<ul>
	<li>Mapmaker: a Qt application for hand-drawing maps to illustrate
	walks. Fairly obviously deprecated by Freemap and OSM. </li>
	<li>Convict: a demo of how to create a platform game with ZXLIB.</li>
	<li>fmapedit: how I used to process GPX traces back in the days when
	OSM barely existed and Freemap was a completely separate project. </li>
	<li>Some early Java experiments from way back in the late 90s, including
	a sprite designer and version of Pacman.</li>
	</ul>
