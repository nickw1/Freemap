<h1>What is Freemap?</h1>
<hr />
<p><em>Freemap</em> is a project to create free 
maps of the countryside, using 
<a href='http://www.openstreetmap.org'>OpenStreetMap</a> data to create the
maps. Freemap maps aim to show not only the official rights of way, but 
all paths with public access, many of which are missing on other maps.</p>

<ul>
<li>Green: public footpath</li>
<li>Brown: public bridleway</li>
<li>Red: byway or restricted byway</li>
<li>Blue: permissive footpath</ul>

<p>Note how some paths and tracks are shown in black and white 
only. These are paths
and tracks for which walkers' rights are unknown, i.e. it is not known whether
they are walkable or private. 
</p>
<h2>Android app - OpenTrail</h2>
<p>Freemap has an accompanying Android app, 
<a href='/common/opentrail.html'>OpenTrail</a>. With OpenTrail you can
add and share notes "in the field" on your device: these will be uploaded
to the database. Furthermore, you can record a walking route while out
walking, add notes to it, upload to the Freemap server 
and share with others.</p>
<p>Furthermore, OpenTrail features the ability to download and "play" 
existing walking routes - so you'll be able to see
walk route directions presented to you on your Android device while out
walking!</p>
<h2 id='norender'>The map isn't showing! Why?</h2>
<p>If the map doesn't show immediately, it's because the map for that
area needs to be rendered (drawn). Generating the map data from the database
takes time as this is a relatively low-spec server. This is particularly
the case if contours have not been generated yet.</p>
It may take some time in built-up areas. However, once an area
of map is drawn, it is cached which means that next time you visit that
area, the map will be drawn much more quickly - a second or two.</p>
<p>Also please note that from early 2012, maps have been drawn in the
browser using vector rendering, for many years with
<a href='http://www.kothic.org/'>kothic-js</a> and now (Nov 2018) with
<a href='https://github.com/tangrams/tangram'>Tangram</a>. 
The decision to switch to in-browser rendering has been
made as a result of the large demands of server-side rendering due to
the increased size of the OpenStreetMap database.</p>
<p>The move to in-browser rendering also means that you will need a moderately 
up-to-date browser (something released in the last 5 years or so); 
in particular, Internet Explorer versions before IE9 will not work.</p>
<h2 id='limitations'>Limitations</h2>
<p>There are some limitations with Freemap as it stands: in 
particular, due to server constraints it's restricted to Britain and Ireland
(with contours only available in England, Wales and the far south of 
Scotland)
and it cannot currently handle certain types of OpenStreetMap data. 
The main example of this is "multipolygon
relations", which is the mechanism OSM uses to handle situations such as
lakes with islands or forests with "holes" of open land within them.
The principle effect is that, 
unfortunately, many of the larger lakes in the Lake District
are not drawn.  This is something that will hopefully be dealt with in the 
future.</p>
<h3 id='source'>Source code</h3>
<p>Freemap
source code is available via gitlab; see
<a href='https://gitlab.com/nickw1/Freemap'>here</a>. The SVN repository is
no longer being maintained.</p>
