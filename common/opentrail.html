<h1>OpenTrail - Freemap for Android</h1>
<hr />
<p>Freemap has a full featured Android app - <em>OpenTrail</em>.
It provides many of the features of a
typical OSM mobile app, but with a few unique features, in particular the
ability to report path problems and add points of interest and path directions
in the field, as well as present these live to you in the field while you are
out walking.</p>

<h2> What can you do with OpenTrail?</h2>
<ul style="margin-left: 10px">
<li>View OpenStreetMap-derived 
maps of the majority of England (Wales and Scotland not covered
just yet) showing public rights of way in the
<a href='/fm/about.html#mapkey'>same colour scheme as Freemap itself</a>
together with Ordnance Survey LandForm PANORAMA contours. The maps are
rendered using the <a href='https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge'>
Mapsforge</a> library and 
initially downloaded to your device, and then stored on the device or 
SD card.</li>
<li>Add annotations to the map in-the-field, which can be shared
with other users. These can be anything you like
(within reason!) and are added to Freemap's annotations database. So you can
share points of interest, interesting views, path directions in awkward
places, and path blockages with other users. Then, when someone else uses
OpenTrail later on, details of that annotation will be presented to them in
the field. It's my aim with Freemap and OpenTrail to produced a crowd-sourced
source of information for walkers throughout the country. Note that 
the annotations will have to be authorised before going live; this should
normally be done within 24 hours.</li>
<li>View annotations and directions in-the-field contributed by other
users. So, if you find yourself in the middle of a large field with no
apparent way out, OpenTrail will tell you where to aim for!</li>
<li>Download and <em>"play"</em>
walking routes from Freemap. As you may know, you can create
walking routes on the main Freemap site; these can be downloaded into
OpenTrail (as GPX files with waypoints for each stage of the route)
and <em>"played" on your device</em>. So, when you get to the start of the
next stage of the walk, the instructions will be presented to you live
in-the-field.</li>
<li>Record new walking routes and save them as GPX files. These can be 
uploaded to Freemap and shared with other users.  Theoretically this
functionality can of course be used to survey new data for OSM, though the
app is not optimised for this.</li> 
<li>Find nearby points of interest (but that's pretty standard for an
OSM mobile app). The POIs are obtained from the Freemap server and
consequently this functionality is only available in areas with Freemap
coverage.</li>
<li>Save annotations on the device for later upload, reducing the need
for network access in-the-field. Also, annotations and POIs are cached
on the device, meaning that after initial network access, the app can
be used completely offline if desired.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="../downloads/android/opentrail03-190118.apk">OpenTrail 0.3</a>,
	works on Android 4.0+. Uses Mapsforge 0.8. Downloads live mapping data
	from the Freemap server and caches it on the device, thus combining
	up-to-date data and offline use. This allows you to
	download the maps at home and use them in the
	field offline - without a network connection. Cache may be 
	cleared by the user, allowing the maps to be updated at any time.</li>
	<li>OpenTrail 0.2 was started but abandoned in favour of 0.3; basically
	it was 0.3 minus the live mapping data.</li>
	<li><a href="../downloads/android/opentrail.apk">OpenTrail 0.1</a>,
	works on Android 2.1+. Uses an older version (0.3) of Mapsforge.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Please <a href="../downloads/android/README_BEFORE_DOWNLOADING.txt">
read this</a> before downloading!</p>
<h2>Missing features?</h2>
<p>
If there are any things you would like to see added, or have ideas
for features that could make it to the next release, please
<a href="mailto:nickw4426@gmail.com">email me</a> (Nick Whitelegg, nickw on
OSM)</p>
<h2>Looking for augmented reality?</h2>
<p>If you were at SOTM or SOTM-EU in 2011, you may remember that I presented
an early version of OpenTrail featuring augmented reality, overlaying OSM
data on the device's camera feed. OpenTrail no longer includes this
functionality, however the AR is still very much in development!
Because it is experimental, it has been moved to its own app, Hikar.
See <a href='hikar.html'>here</a>.</p>
<h2>Source code</h2>
<p>OpenTrail is an open-source application (GPL; libraries are LGPL): see
the <a href="https://github.com/nickw1/Freemap">Freemap github page</a>,
OpenTrail source is in the "java" directory.</p>
<p><a href="/fm/index.php">Back to Freemap</a></p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy policy</h2>
<p>OpenTrail does not currently send any personal information (such as your
Google login) to the Freemap server. All data sent (i.e. your notes and their
location, and your walk routes including latitude and longitude of your track)
is completely anonymous. The Freemap site administrator will then authorise
your data if it is legitimate and non-offensive. It is planned in a future
version to allow you to login to Freemap via OpenTrail. Even then, login 
information will only be used to allow auto-authorisation of contributions by
legitimate users.</p>
